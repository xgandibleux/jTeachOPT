# metaUKP
Implementation in Julia of well-known optimization algorithms for pedagogical purposes


Currently : 
- Heuristics and metaheuristics applied on the 0/1 unidimensional knapsack problem (01UKP) 


Algorithms/procedures implemented :
-  Generator of instances for the 01UKP
-  Solution computed by descend constructive method for the 01UKP
-  Random feasible solution for the 01UKP
-  Upper bound computed by linear relaxation of the 01UKP
-  Simple exploration heuristic (heuExplore)
-  Simulated Annealing metaheuristic (metaSA)
-  swap move for the 01UKP (swap)
-  add_or_drop move for the 01UKP (addOrDrop)
-  Plotting solutions and the cooling schedule
